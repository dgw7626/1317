<h1>AI and Automation</h1>


<h4>AI technology to human capabilities</h4>
<p>Ai technology validates human-like capabilities such as learning and problem solving. 
  Such technological advances can be seen in modern society such as Tesla with their self-driving vehicles. 
  The current ai technology Tesla has adopted uses unsupervised machine learning with physically integrated chips.
   These chips aim to improve the accuracy of the machineâ€™s decision making with 6 billion transistors. 
   Currently, they are designed and implemented to navigate traffic and its surroundings.
    Another example of AI technology is exhibited by Boston Dynamic.
    They have showcased AI technology within robots with advanced mobility and dexterity. 
    These robots have the ability to navigate through rugged and unpredictable terrain and can automate the route.
     Boston Dynamic utilises their hand coded control algorithms to accurately evaluate data and prediction.
      However, they do not use any moden machine learning technology.
       They have engineered their technology to endeavour on unsafe and dangerous work thus, is suitable for hostile environments such as radioactive contamination areas.</p>
<h4>Automation in modern technology society</h4>
<p>Automation technology is built to do a repetitive job from human work, it requires humans to manipulate the automation process. This technology has less-cost, 24 hours active machinery. Negative side of this technology is it needs specific order to proceed with some kind of action. Ports of Auckland is a sea ports operator company. They use automation to move containers in the right place but automation progress has difficulty moving to unrecognizable places. Their operators have to manually proceed to put unrecognizable places. Automation cannot respond to sudden changes to unpredictable variables from the environment.</p>
