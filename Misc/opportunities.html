<h1>Opportunities</h1>


<h4>Provides a solution for human work</h4>
<p>Human work progress can be difficult and complicated, repetitive jobs can be done accurately through AI and automation processes. which eliminates human error from human work. It will increase the human work performance from complex activities, content moderation. Surgery operation is used by machine handling, robotic arms to improve the accuracy of the operation. Solutions are provided for better handling ai and automation methods.<p></p>
<h4>Produces a Safe Environment</h4>
<p>Restricted environment can be approached by robots to do dangerous work such as heavy lifting work or transporting radioactive/chemical items. Any activities that damage the human condition are eliminated by robots, so it can make the environment safer and more efficient.</p>
<p>In large, Automation removes the need for repetitive dangerous work - work that can otherwise be done with machines and computers - THese advances can be seen nearby in the POrts of Auckland. Though contentious at points, when successful the pilot programme is expected to effectively double the capacity of the yard. As well as this, the Ports of Auckland has been the subject of scrutiny due to 3 workyard deaths, each linked to human error. With successful automation, this could eliminate any need for human casualties in the future.</p>
<p>Automation in the form of Algorithms is a technology that is only now seeing its potential met. Across the world today people find media, friends, even relationships due to algorithmic automation. On a scale unheard of before the internet today, Youtube alone receives 5 billion video views per day, many delivered via algorithms to cater to their interests.</p>
