<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>Looking back at my research on this topic I’ve been stunned again and again by the sheer capability of AI and Automation. My feelings of awe have been matched by my feelings of disappointment in seeing how AI and Automation is mostly used to make money more efficiently.</p>
<p>AI automation is used mostly to harvest your data so that companies can be better positioned to sell you things. There is very little regulation as this is a relatively new field, therefore it is exploited regularly.</p>
<p>On the flip side I think this just happens to be a natural part of human behaviour, I don’t fault people for wanting to earn a living. As well as this, I disagree with the luddite sentiment that people should not lose jobs to AI automation. Its an unfortunate reality that people’s jobs will be made redundant by the proliferation of AI automation. This can be delayed but not avoided, progress finds a way. Instead, I think more can be done so that governments are better positioned to retrain or redeploy people made redundant by automation.</p>
<p>My last reflection is this: I think it a sad thing that AI is seen purely for its capitalist potential and not how it can raise societies up.</p>
