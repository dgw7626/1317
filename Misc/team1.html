<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>Ai and Automation has many potential capabilities for human work. this advanced technology can be replaced by repetitive task or complicating task, it has 24-hour active machinery. Negative side of this technology could decrease the job availability because it will take all jobs that contains repetitive task. I think automation task should be limited to job availability people might lose the job. To avoid the job loss, it needs to limit some activities like law or medical operation.</p><br>
