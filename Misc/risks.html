<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


<p>Studies suggest that the most immediate risk of applications will affect job automation the most, typically low-wage jobs such as office, food-services, admin and cashiers. Jobs that also involve repetitive tasks are most vulnerable to being replaced by automation and AI, due to the machine learning algorithms the AI will improve at faster rates than a human, due to human restrictions automation makes it more cost efficient for companies to invest in AI as it greatly improves the workload without losing earnings on paying employees and drawbacks. AI will not completely replace humans in the workforce as employees are also able to work alongside with AI, as many jobs require judgement calls which is difficult for Artificial intelligence to accomplish, as well as AI being in its earlier stages the machines require advice when it comes to judgement calls in the workforce M.Thomas(2019). Jobs that require compassion and care are most likely to remain the same as artificial intelligence can not mimic the same emotions that we humans have. Lawyer and Judge jobs will not be replaced as it requires strong case analysis and a lot of personal experience, it requires difficult decision making such as final decisions. Some of the risks of implementing AI is that it is constantly learning and it is very unpredictable for how it may turn out in the future whether the AI may be able to think for itself or not, this may pose a risk to humans if artificial intelligence is not monitored properly B.Marr(2020). Examples of artificial intelligence failing during use can be pronounced in the viral video of a Tesla Model 3 colliding into a truck that had been tipped over in the highway, which lead to the killing of the driver and injuring the truck driver. The Tesla vehicle was unable to recognise the truck, although the car has self-driving features that allow the driver to commute handsfree it is still in its early stages of development which could lead to unnecessary crashes. Ai can also pose a threat to security systems as criminals and hackers are able to create artificial intelligence as a source of virus to cause harm which can threaten privacy and security within companies and personal information. For instance, Artificial intelligence is able to form realistic social media profiles that can be very similar to real profiles, as well as audio queues which will also raise the chances of fraud taking place within the social media and digital media realm. Artificial Intelligence has many flaws that can lead to big risks in the near future, as AI is able to self learn and become smarter each day it is very possible that AI can form opinions and a personality of its own. This poses a big threat to society as artificial intelligence may not have the same personality as a human does and could very well side against us as humans, as long as AI is monitored correctly and is able to stay in a neutral state then AI will not pose a threat to society. AI systems are constantly advancing and are becoming smarter and smarter and could eventually become superior to humans, as artificial intelligence does not have as many weaknesses as we humans do, especially if artificial intelligence were to take control over firearms and other destructive forces it could lead to widespread disasters and destruction. Although AI posemany benefits that are able to provide help within workload and production in the workforce as well as solving algorithms much quicker than human beings. Artificial intelligence and automation may pose a threat to low wage workers in the near future as companies will soon recognise that it is more reliable and beneficial to implement an artificial intelligence system of working rather than on human employees as it is more cost efficient and improves the rate of productive work J.Burden (2021) . As artificial intelligence is not perfected and is only still developing it is a big risk to implement artificial intelligence to consumer services as artificial intelligence still has many flaws which can be noticed in the accidents caused in the tesla vehicle, this example shows the many risk that could be capable if artificial intelligence has not been reliably tested and monitored as the system may not be smart enough to recognise certain hazards to prevent harm to humans or consumers. Artificial intelligence also poses a threat within society as the artificial intelligence mobile learning system allows it to adapt to environments it may also learn to form a personality, this poses a big threat as artificial intelligence may become smart enough to overcome human control when not monitored correctly. This process can simply be done by social influences that surround the artificial intelligence and using the advanced learning system the artificial intelligence may be confused and reprogram itself to form an opinion which could lead to negativity B.Marr(2020).<p>
