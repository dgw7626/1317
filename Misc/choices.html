<h1>Ethical Choices of AI and Automation</h1>


<p>I have decided to explore the choices of AI and automation in the form of differing options used to solve similar problems. In this case, the contrasting approaches of the Ports of Auckland (PoA) and Amazon.</p>
<p>Pure AI or assisted: When automating, to what degree does the human element need to be eliminated or retained and why?</p>
<p>When making the choice to Automate,PoA made the decision with two goals in mind:</p>
<p>The first goal relates to overcoming the physical restrictions of its physical footprint. The PoA are limited by the land they have to work with but a growing population to meet the demands of. At the stage where the decision to Automate was made, human operated cranes were already at their limit in terms of efficiency.</p>
<p>The second goal was to reduce the amount of injuries related to employees being overworked to keep up with demand, relating in part to the first goal. At the point where automation was decided on, due to the demands put on staff for efficiency, workplace H&S as well as a workplace death had become a concern for the stakeholders of PoA and the public at large. This was present in the media as well, and led to a wide call to action.</p>
<p>With these two goals in mind, Automation was a logical solution to the problems facing PoA. When choosing specifically how to address their issues, the PoA went with a near 50/50 approach. All automated cranes handle the back end but simple operations while human driven cranes handle the more complex see-ward operations.</p>
<p>In terms of operation, the Ports of Auckland uses a handshake approach to automated logistics. Environmental data is fed into algorithms through on board cameras that execute decisions based on prior instructions. Human oversight is created through a centralised monitoring station that tracks all automated cranes.</p>
<p>The dual nature of the PoA lends flexibility towards its capability. People cover proverbial blind spots on the automated side and vice versa. This lends the overall system resilience and redundancy should one part of the system fall through.</p>
<p>By contrast, Amazon has automated wherever possible to improve efficiency and reduce overhead expenses. In doing so, Amazon has led the field of automation in many regards in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>On a global level, Amazon uses deep learning to predict what purchasing trends will occur before they do. In this way, warehouses are positioned to fill needs as they arise and avoid shortages.</p>
<p>On a warehouse level, AI is used to guide up to 800 robots per warehouse in a manner similar to an Air Controller at a busy airport. This allows the many robots to function effectively without interfering with each other.</p>
<p>On an individual robotic level, environmental data is fed into it via mounted cameras and sensors on board. This allows each robot to navigate otherwise unaccounted for hazards.</p>
<p>The end result is a highly automated factory with relatively few staff filling relatively few roles. Overhead has been slashed immensely and efficiency has increased dramatically.</p>
<p>Despite this automation has not been without faults. Automating fulfilment centres caused a spike in workplace related injuries as people were forced to keep up with the machines and still are.</p>
<p>When contrasting the choices made by the PoA and Amazon we can see how both are trying to solve the same problems with similar technology. The difference then seems to come in the shape of how the automated and human work forces are separated (or in some cases not).</p>
<p>The PoA increased operational capacity and shortened turn over for ships and cargo arriving in harbour. This was also accomplished without compromising on the health and safety of their employees. By keeping the spaces where people and machines work separate, they have effectively eliminated the possibility of injury during day to day operations.</p>
<p>Amazon have also met success, at least in terms of cost reduction and overall efficiency. Due to the nature of Amazon’s fulfilment centres however, people still work quite closely with  the machines. Rather then having two closed systems such as PoA, they have one hybrid system. Its largely due to this interaction that the other promise of automation has not been met, and people are still performing dangerous tasks.</p>
<p>The choice presented to people then is, to what degree do you wish to implement AI Automated systems alongside Human ones. In the case of PoA, human oversight of AI systems has proven effective. In the case of Amazon, working directly along side AI has given rise to further problems.</p>
<p>In any case, true pure AI controlled logistical systems are at least a decade away by Amazon’s best estimates and even then, it is likely that direct human oversight will still be necessary, even then.</p>
